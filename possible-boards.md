Beaglebone Black
================
Current frontrunner, $45 for a full computer, including HDMI output. It  includes some on board memory, not sure if can be re-written with a Linux distribution instead of Angstrom.

Raspberry Pi 
===============
Has a great community, and is even cheaper at $25 for the model A or $35 for the model B. We would only need the model A, since network would be wifi. One big advantage with this board is that it has an available camera 
module, which could make the entire photo gathering process automatic.

Cubieboard
==========
Seems to be over-proced and under-powered

ODROID-U2
=========
Quite a bit more powerful, but more expensive at $89, and a long lead time

ODROID-X2
=========
Same power as the ODROID-U2, but more IO ports, such as audio. Also, more money at $135 and weeks of lead time.

Udoo
====
Still vaporware, but something to watch

Pinochio
========
Has wireless built-in. Vaporware, might not be powerful enough

Jeenode
=======
Not powerful enough, but still interesting, $25

Wandboard
=========
Available, not much info, maybe more than is needed.
