Beaglebone Black
================
Current frontrunner, $45 for a full computer, including HDMI output. It  includes some on board memory, not sure if can be re-written with a Linux distribution instead of Angstrom.

Raspberry Pi 
===============
Has a great community, and is even cheaper at $25 for the model A or $35 for the model B. We would only need the model A, since network would be wifi

Cubieboard
==========
Seems to be over-proced and under-powered

ODROID-U2
=========
Quite a bit more powerful, but more expensive

Udoo
====
Still vaporware, but something to watch

Pinochio
========
Has wireless built-in. Vaporware, might not be powerful enough

Jeenode
=======
Not powerful enough, but still interesting, $25

Wandboard
=========
Available, not much info, maybe more than is needed.
